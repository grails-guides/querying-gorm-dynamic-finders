Since our databases and Grails domain classes can contain properties that might
hold null values, we need ways to query those situations. For example, in our original
service implementations, we have two methods used to find which games played are complete
and which are still ongoing.
[source,groovy]
----
include::initial/grails-app/services/demo/QueryService.groovy[tag=findByNull,indent=0]

include::initial/grails-app/services/demo/QueryService.groovy[tag=findByNotNull,indent=0]
----

The comparators for checking null values are `IsNull` and `IsNotNull`. These are
special in that they require no arguments for the dynamic finder. Here is the
improved implementation:

[source,groovy]
----
include::complete/grails-app/services/demo/QueryService.groovy[tag=findByNull,indent=0]

include::complete/grails-app/services/demo/QueryService.groovy[tag=findByNotNull,indent=0]
