The previous methods searched for matching instances by value equality. Dynamic finders
can search also by inequality: whether the property is not equal to, is greater than,
or is less than the provided value.

Let's look at `QueryService.queryGamesNotConsideredStrategy` which attempts to find all
games that, according to the database, are not marked as strategy games.
[source,groovy]
----
include::initial/grails-app/services/demo/QueryService.groovy[tag=findAllNotEqual]
----

NOTE: It would be more idiomatic to write the predicate as `!it.strategy`, but for this
demo, the not-equal comparison against `true` is made explicit to better illustrate the
similarity between the inefficient version and the dynamic finder version.

Since we expect there will be more than one result, we still need to use the prefix
`findAllBy`. The property of interest is `strategy`, a boolean flag. But using the dynamic
finder `findAllByStrategy(true)` finds all of the strategy games, and we want the non-strategy
games. In order to find those, we need to add a *comparator*. A comparator changes the query
from an equality test to something else. You'll see many of
these in the sections to follow. Here, we will use the comparator `NotEqual` which, when
appended to the property name in the dynamic finder method name, generates a query that
matches on non-equality.

Our improved query to find non-strategy games is then:
[source,groovy]
----
include::complete/grails-app/services/demo/QueryService.groovy[tag=findAllNotEqual]
----
<1> This query demonstrates the general form of a dynamic finder using the `NotEqual` comparator.
<2> This query demonstrates the <<simplerBooleans,exceptional form>> of dynamic finders for boolean properties.

NOTE: Though the second form shown here is more compact and readable, the first form
using the `NotEqual` comparator will work equally well for any database types; it is used
here with a boolean property simply to demonstrate how the comparator works.

What if we want a greater than or less than comparison? Let's look at
`QueryService.queryGamesExpectedShorterThan`, which will return a list of
games with an average duration shorter than the provided value.
[source,groovy]
----
include::initial/grails-app/services/demo/QueryService.groovy[tag=findAllByLessThan]
----

At this point, we know to start with `findAllByAverageDuration`. Since we want to
match property values that are *less than* the provided value, we should use the
`LessThan` comparator. Again, this comparator is appended after the property name,
so our final, improved implementation is:
[source,groovy]
----
include::complete/grails-app/services/demo/QueryService.groovy[tag=findAllByLessThan]
----

There is a similar comparator when you need instances with property values *greater than* the
supplied argument: use `GreaterThan`. For example, `QueryService.queryGamesRatedMoreThan` will
find all games with a rating higher than the provided rating. The original implementation:

[source,groovy]
----
include::initial/grails-app/services/demo/QueryService.groovy[tag=findAllByGreaterThan]
----

Our dynamic finder for this query will be called `findAllByRatingGreaterThan`.
[source,groovy]
----
include::complete/grails-app/services/demo/QueryService.groovy[tag=findAllByGreaterThan]
----

The `LessThan` and `GreaterThan` comparators are _strict_ inequality comparisons; that is,
if the values compared are equal, the instance is *not* considered a match. If you need to
also include equality, use the non-strict `LessThanEquals` and `GreaterThanEquals` comparators.
