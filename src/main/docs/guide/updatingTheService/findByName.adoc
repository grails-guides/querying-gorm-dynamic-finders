Our first method to update is `QueryService.queryGame` which takes a single `name` parameter.
The existing code loads all instances of the `Game` domain class, and searches for those whose
name matches the parameter.

    def queryGame(String name) {
        Game.all.find {
            it.name == name
        }
    }

This is highly inefficient code! The `getAll` method on `Game` does exactly what it
sounds like: it fetches all of the records from the database into memory.
