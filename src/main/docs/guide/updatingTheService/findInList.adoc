In the above sections, we have been able to find instances through a property: by equality,
by inequality, by values between bounds. Sometimes, though, the matching values for a property
do not form a simple range. With dynamic finders, you can find records where a property is
tested against items from a provided list: use the `InList` comparator.

Here are two examples. The first finds all of the `Game` records that match a list of `String` game
names, while the second example finds all `Match` records that track the game play of the games
listed.

By using the `InList` comparator and passing in the list of items to match against, we can
reduce these methods to be more efficient.

In the second example, `QueryService.queryMatchesForGames`, note that the list does not
contain simple types (like `Number` or `String`), but actually contains a list of `Game`
domain objects. This is reasonable, since the property `game` of `Match` *is an instance
of `Game`*.

Anytime you have a relationship like this, you can use domain class instances as part of
your query. As another example, the `Score` domain references the `Player` domain, and so,
for example, to find all of the scores by a particular player:
[source,groovy]
----
    def jeffBrown = Player.findByName('Jeff Brown')
    def scores = Score.findByPlayer(jeffBrown)
----

Related to the `InList` comparator is the `NotInList` comparator which, as it sounds, finds
matching instances where the property under test is *not* found in the provided list. So, for
the inefficient implementation of `QueryService.quequeryGamesOtherThan`:
[source,groovy]
----
include::initial/grails-app/services/demo/QueryService.groovy[tag=findNotInList]
----

This can be replaced using the `NotInList` comparator:
