There will be times when you want to find records by more than one property. Let's take
an example: we want to find all the board games that support a certain number of players.
Our inefficient implementation looks like this:
[source,groovy]
----
include::initial/grails-app/services/demo/QueryService.groovy[tag=findCombinatorAnd]
----

These implementation use equality and less-than-or-equals operators; we already know how
to search for these things independently. For example, to find where the minimum number of
players is no higher than the requested player count, we would do this:
[source,groovy]
----
    def games = Game.findAllByMinPlayersLessThanEqual(playerCount)
----

Or to find those games where the maximum number of players is no less than the requested
player count, we would do this:
[source,groovy]
----
    def games = Game.findAllByMaxPlayersGreaterThanEqual(playerCount)
----

Because `minPlayers` and `maxPlayers` are different properties, we can't use the `Between`
or `InRange` comparators, as they operate on a single property.

Instead, we introduce here *combinators*. These are the boolean operators `And` and `Or`.
So if we want to combine two requirements (i.e. a property and its comparator), we join them
using `And` if we require both requirements to pass, or `Or` if only one is required to pass.

For our current example, we want to combine `findAllByMinPlayersLessThanEqual` and
`findAllByMaxPlayersGreaterThanEqual`, requiring both statements to pass (which matches the
boolean-and operator `&&` of the inefficient implementation). When joining these, the prefix
(e.g. `findAllBy`) only needs to be specified once; then, our `And` combined query becomes
`findAllByMinPlayersLessThanEqualAndMaxPlayersGreaterThanEqual`, and the final dynamic finder
method call will take two arguments: one for `minPlayers` and one for `maxPlayers`.

include::complete/grails-app/services/demo/QueryService.groovy[tag=findCombinatorAnd]

Another similar example: find all board games supporting an exact number of players (i.e.
where `minPlayers` and `maxPlayers` are equal to the same number). The original implementation:
[source,groovy]
----
include::initial/grails-app/services/demo/QueryService.groovy[tag=findCombinatorAnd2]
----

and the improved implementation:
[source,groovy]
----
include::complete/grails-app/services/demo/QueryService.groovy[tag=findCombinatorAnd2]
----

NOTE: You are not limited to two predicates in your dynamic finder. You can use the `And` multiple
times to join as many predicates (i.e. query requirements) as you need. However, past two or
three predicates, you may find that your dynamic finder becomes difficult to read. Complex queries
may be implemented more legibly by using
http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#querying[other query techniques]; these will
be the topics of future guides.

If we don't require *both* parts of the combination to pass, we can use the `Or` combiner
(which compares to the boolean-or operator `||`). In `QueryService.queryGamesConsideredFamilyOrParty`,
the original implementation:
[source,groovy]
----
include::initial/grails-app/services/demo/QueryService.groovy[tag=findCombinatorOr]
----

can be replaced with an improved implementation:
[source,groovy]
----
include::complete/grails-app/services/demo/QueryService.groovy[tag=findCombinatorOr]
----

WARNING: While a dynamic finder may use any number of `And` combiners or any number of `Or`
combiners, you *cannot* use `And` and `Or` together in the same dynamic finder. So this query
and those like it are invalid: `Game.findByMinPlayersAndMaxPlayersOrParty(2, 5, true)`. To
specify a condition such as this, you need to use
http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#querying[other query techniques].
