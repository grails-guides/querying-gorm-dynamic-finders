Knowing how to find one instance by a property value, we can find multiple instances by a
(non-unique) property value by changing the prefix. Instead of `findBy`, use `findAllBy` to
return a list of matching instances. If none match, the list will be empty.

Let's update `QueryService.queryGamesWithAverageDuration`, a method used to collect all of
the board games with the provided average duration. Here is the existing, inefficient implementation:

As before, this poor implementation loads all records into memory, then searches over them.
The database engine is much quicker, and the memory load is much lower to return only the
matching records, so let's change this to a dynamic finder.

To find multiple records, use the `findAllBy` prefix. Append the property name `averageDuration`
(updating capitalization for consistent camel-case of the dynamic finder method name), and pass
the `averageDuration` parameter from `queryGamesWithAverageDuration` as an argument to the
dynamic finder method call.
