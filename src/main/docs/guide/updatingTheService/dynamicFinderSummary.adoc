== Prefixes

[%header, cols="1,3", width="60%", format=csv]
|===
Prefix,Purpose
`findBy`,Find a single instance that matches the query.
`findAllBy`,Find multiple instances that match the query.
`countBy`,Count how many instances match the query.
|===

== Comparators

In the following table, `prop` represents some property of a domain instance, while
`val` (or similar) represents the parameter value to compare against.
[%header,cols="1,2,2,3"]
|===
|Comparator
|Example
|Equivalent Groovy Code
|Purpose

|<none>
|`findAllByProp(val)`
|`prop == val`
|Tests property is equal to value.

|`NotEqual`
|`findAllByPropNotEqual(val)`
|`prop != val`
|Tests property is not equal to value.

|`LessThan`
|`findAllByPropLessThan(val)`
|`prop < val`
|Tests property is less than value.

|`LessThanEquals`
|`findAllByPropLessThanEquals(val)`
|`prop &lt;= val`
|Tests property is less than or equal to value.

|`GreaterThan`
|`findAllByPropGreaterThan(val)`
|`prop > val`
|Tests property is greater than value.

|`GreaterThanEquals`
|`findAllByPropGreaterThanEquals(val)`
|`prop >= val`
|Tests property is greater than or equal to value.

|`Between`
|`findAllByPropBetween(lowerVal, upperVal)`
|`(lowerVal &lt;= prop) && (prop &lt;= upperVal)`
|Tests property is between lowerVal and upperVal. Requires two arguments.

|`InRange`
|`findAllByPropInRange(val)`
|`prop in val`
|Tests property is in range specified by val (of `Range` type).

|`Like`
|`findAllByPropLike(val)`
|No exact equivalent. Similar to `prop.endsWith(val)`, `prop.startsWith(val)`,
 `prop.contains(val)`, depending on search string.
|Tests property matches using wildcard string comparison. Use `%` for wildcard.
 Case-sensitive.

|`Ilike`
|`findAllByPropIlike(val)`
|Same as `Like`.
|Same as `Like`, but case-insensitive.

|`Rlike`
|`findAllByPropRlike(val)`
|`prop ==~ val`
|Tests property matches using regular expression.

|`IsNull`
|`findAllByPropIsNull`()
|`prop == null`
|Tests property is null. Requires no arguments.

|`IsNotNull`
|`findAllByPropIsNull`()
|`prop != null`
|Tests property is not null. Requires no arguments.
|===

== Combiners

Within a single dynamic finder method name, you may use either `And` or `Or` multiple
times to combine multiple criteria, but you cannot use both `And` and `Or` in the same
dynamic finder.

[%header, cols="1,2,2,3"]
|===
|Combiner
|Example
|Equivalent Groovy Code
|Purpose

|`And`
|`findByNameAndYearLessThan('Foo', 2017)`
|`(name == 'Foo') && (year < 2017)`
|Both expressions must match for the instance to match.

|`Or`
|`findByAgeLessThanOrAgeGreaterThan(8,88)`
|`(age < 8) \|\| (age > 88)`
|At least one expression must match for the instance to match.
|===

== Parameters

Pagination and sorting are done by adding a final `Map` argument to any dynamic finder.
The map may contain the following parameters:

[%header, cols="1,4"]
|===
|Parameter
|Purpose

|`sort`
|All matching instances are sorted according to the property specified.
 Sorting is done _before_ the `offset` and `max` parameters are applied.

|`order`
|Sets the sorting order to either ascending/increasing (`'asc'`) or
 descending/decreasing (`'desc'`).

|`offset`
|From all matching, sorted instances, `offset` specifies the index of the first
 instance to be returned. Used for paginating results.

|`max`
|From all matching, sorted instances, `max` specifies the upper limit of how
 many instances to return. Used for paginating results.
|===

For example, the following finds all games with an average duration between 30 and
90 minutes, sorted by their average duration (`sort: 'averageDuration'`), starting
with the longest (order: 'desc'), and returning only the first five
(`offset: 0, max: 5`) results.
```
    Game.findAllByAverageDurationInRange(30..90,
            [sort: 'averageDuration', order: 'desc', offset: 0, max: 5])
```
