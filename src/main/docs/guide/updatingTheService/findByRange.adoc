What if you need to find instances where some property falls in between two values?
Maybe you want to know all the games played (represented by the domain class `Match`) between two dates?

Use the comparator `Between`. As mentioned earlier, most comparators expect a matching argument
in the dynamic finder call. However, `Between` is one of the exceptions, and it expects *two* arguments:
the lower and upper bounds. In the case of `QueryService.queryMatchesPlayedBetweenDates`, the lower and
upper bounds are the start and finish dates.

NOTE: We will use the `started` property of `Match` as the property to examine. We could
have chosen to look at the `finished` property, but that could be null while `started`
cannot be null according to the constraints of `Match`.

Now we know the parts to build up our dynamic finder call: `findAllBy` to look for multiple,
matching instances; `started` as the property to examine; and `Between` as the operator to
find values of the property between provided lower and upper bounds. Here is the efficient
implementation.

A similar comparator is `InRange`, which works like `Between` but accepts a Groovy range as
the argument. As an example, we want to find out how many high scores there are across all
played games. Let's define high scores to be in the range 90-100.
[source,groovy]
----
    Range highScore = 90..100
    def numHighScores = queryService.queryHowManyScoresWithinRange(highScore)

Here's the old, inefficient implementation of `queryHowManyScoresWithinRange`:
[source,groovy]
----
include::initial/grails-app/services/demo/QueryService.groovy[tag=findByRange]
----

Since we only want to know how many high scores there are (and not the scores themselves),
we'll use the `countBy` prefix. We need to look at the `score` property of the `Score`
domain class, and we'll use `InRange` to compare against the provided range. Here is
the improved implementation.
