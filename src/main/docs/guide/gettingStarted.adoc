In this guide, you are going to update a Grails service to more efficiently query a
database. The service methods currently load all records from a table and search
through them in-memory; you will change those methods to use
http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html[GORM]
http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#finders[Dynamic Finders],
which are more efficient all around.
