http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#finders[Dynamic finders] are methods generated
at runtime. Though the methods don't exist initially, Grails uses the Groovy metaprogramming hooks
http://groovy-lang.org/metaprogramming.html#_methodmissing[`methodMissing`] and
http://groovy-lang.org/metaprogramming.html#_propertymissing[`propertyMissing`] to recognize when you
attempt to call one. Grails will then examine the method name you use and generate an appropriate
implementation, including the corresponding database query.

Dynamic finders read like English commands. For example, if I want to find all books published between
2001 and 2012, my query might look like this:

[source,groovy]
----
def books = Book.findAllByYearPublishedBetween(2001, 2012)
----

This guide will explore ways to build dynamic finders by updating all the methods in
`QueryService` with implementations that use dynamic finders, such that the new
implementations continue to pass all unit tests in `QueryServiceSpec`.
